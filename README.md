# üöó Used-Car Price Prediction Project

A data-driven approach to pricing used-car inventory, this project follows the **CRISP-DM framework** to deliver actionable insights for automotive dealerships. The goal is to predict the resale value of over +400k used-car listings and provide data-backed pricing guidance.

## üìù Executive Summary

### üéØ Key Findings:
- **üìä Model Performance**: 2 pipelines were tested (`RidgeCV` & `Lasso Selector ‚Üí Ridge`), both achieve nearly identical performance (RMSE ~$7,200 / MAE ~$5,000)
- **üîß Feature Selection Impact**: Lasso feature selection removes 23% (87 out of 374) of features with minimal performance trade-off
- **‚ö° Model Agreement**: 80% overlap in top 20 most important features between models
- **üèÜ Top Predictors**: Tesla brand, fuel type (electric/hybrid), and vehicle condition drive predictions

### üìà Business Impact:
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Models predict prices within ~$5,000 (27% of average price)
- **Feature Insights**: Premium brands and fuel efficiency significantly impact valuation


## üíº 1. Business Understanding

### Project Motivation
Used-car prices vary wildly‚Äîeven for nearly identical vehicles. **Dealerships that price too high lose sales; price too low and they leave money on the table.** Our core business problem is to mitigate this risk.

> *Which factors most strongly influence the sale price of a used car, and how can we set a competitive yet profitable asking price for every vehicle in inventory?*

### Business & Analytics Objectives
| | Goal |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Business Objective** | *Maximize gross profit **and** inventory turnover* by pricing each unit within a data-driven range that local buyers are willing to pay. |
| **Analytics Objective** | Ship a **pricing-assist notebook** that returns:<br>1) **Best-guess price** (point estimate)<br>2) **Prediction interval** (lower / upper bound)<br>3) **Feature-driven explanations** for every estimate |

### Success Criteria
The primary success metric is a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ‚â§ $1,600** on a hold-out test set.

> **Why $1,600?**  
> - The typical gross profit per used car in the U.S. is **$1,300 ‚Äì $1,600**.
> - Keeping MAE below this threshold caps pricing error so it doesn't eliminate the profit margin on an average vehicle.
> - This corresponds to a ~6.5% MAPE on an average retail price of $25k, an acceptable band for the business.

## üìä 2. Data Understanding
The analysis is based on a Kaggle dataset of 426,880 raw vehicle listings. After cleaning, 312,846 unique vehicle records were retained for modeling. The target variable is `price` (USD), and key predictors include vehicle age, odometer reading, manufacturer, model, and condition.

### Key Data Distributions

| Price Distribution | Odometer Distribution | Year Distribution |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Price Distribution](images/price_histogram.png) | ![Odometer Distribution](images/odometer_histogram.png) | ![Year Distribution](images/year_histogram.png) |

*Outliers were filtered to focus on prices between $1 and $50,000, odometers up to 200,000 miles, and model years from 2005-2023.*

### Categorical Feature Insights

**Manufacturer & Model Counts:** The market is dominated by a few key players. Ford and Chevrolet are the most frequent manufacturers, with the F-150 and Silverado pickups being top models.

| Top Manufacturers | Top Models |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Manufacturer Counts](images/manufacturer_counts.png) | ![Model Counts](images/model_counts.png) |

**Vehicle Condition Analysis:** Most vehicles are listed in "Good" or "Excellent" condition. A heatmap reveals that the median price is highly sensitive to both the manufacturer and the vehicle's condition, with premium brands like Porsche and Tesla commanding higher prices across all conditions.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Data Preparation

The raw dataset of **426,880 records** was transformed into a clean, modeling-ready dataset of **312,846 records** (73% retention).

### Key Achievements:
- ‚úÖ **Missing Data Handled:** Treated 40-70% missing values in critical features (`condition`, `paint_color`, `type`) via imputation.
- ‚úÖ **High Cardinality Reduced:** Shrunk 29k+ unique models to 116 categories and 404 regions to 121 by grouping less frequent entries into "other" categories.
- ‚úÖ **Outliers Filtered:** Constrained data to realistic price ($1-$50k), mileage (0-200k), and year (2005-2023) ranges.
- ‚úÖ **Features Optimized:** Dropped 4 non-predictive columns, retaining 14 features for modeling.

The final dataset is free of missing values with standardized categories, ready for the modeling phase.

## üìà 4. Modeling

### ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering Pipeline
This project constructs a sophisticated preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw features into model-ready inputs:

**üîß Transformation Steps:**
1. **üìÖ Age Calculation**: Convert `year` ‚Üí `age` (current_year - vehicle_year)
2. **üìà Polynomial Features**: Generate `age¬≤` and `odometer¬≤` for non-linear relationships
3. **üîó Interaction Terms**: Create `age √ó odometer` interaction feature
4. **üè∑Ô∏è Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding with first category dropped
5. **üìè Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization for numerical features

**üéØ Pipeline Architecture:**
- **Categorical Pipeline**: OneHotEncoder ‚Üí handles unknown categories gracefully
- **Age Pipeline**: Year‚ÜíAge transformation ‚Üí Polynomial(degree=2) ‚Üí StandardScaler  
- **Odometer Pipeline**: Polynomial(degree=2) ‚Üí StandardScaler
- **Interaction Pipeline**: Age√óOdometer multiplication ‚Üí StandardScaler

### üèÜ Key Results
- **Best Model**: Lasso Feature Selection + Ridge (`selector__estimator__alpha=0.01`, `model__alpha=1.0`)
- **Performance**: RMSE of **$7,130** (13.1% improvement over worst configuration)
- **Training Data**: 312,846 used car records with 12 engineered features
- **Feature Engineering**: `year` ‚Üí `age` transformation, polynomial features for `age` and `odometer` (degree = 2), and interaction term (age x odometer)


## üíØ 5. Evaluation

The final model was evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (62,570 records).

*   **Performance**:
    *   **RMSE**: ‚âà $7,208
    *   **MAE**: ‚âà $5,062
    *   **R¬≤**: ‚âà 0.644
*   **Top Value Drivers**:
    *   **Brand** ‚Äì Tesla & premium manufacturers like Porsche command the highest prices.
    *   **Model** - Specific high-demand models like the Corvette also significantly increase value.
    *   **Fuel Type** ‚Äì Electric & hybrid vehicles have distinct pricing patterns.
    *   **Condition** ‚Äì Vehicles sold for "parts only" see a major price reduction.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Gap to Success Criterion**  
> The current MAE of ~$5,000 exceeds the **$1,600 target**. Future work should focus on richer feature sets (e.g., service records, local market comparables) and more complex, non-linear models like Gradient Boosting or neural networks to capture more nuanced relationships.

### Error Analysis
The model's predictions are generally well-aligned with actual prices, but some outliers exist. The chart below shows actual vs. predicted prices and the distribution of prediction errors on a sample of 10 vehicles.

## üöÄ 6. Deployment

The final, trained `scikit-learn` pipeline is available in `notebooks/deploy.ipynb`. It is ready to make predictions on new, unseen data. The notebook provides a simple interface to input vehicle details and receive a price estimate.

**Usage Example:**
A 2015 Chevrolet Impala in "excellent" condition with 25,000 miles is predicted to have a price of **$14,497**.
